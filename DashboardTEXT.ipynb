The availability of each of these time series varies by area.\n",

    "- COVID-19 cases are identified by taking specimens from people and testing them for the presence of the COVID-19 virus. If the test is positive, this is a referred to as a case. If a person has had more than one positive test they are only counted as one case.\n",

The cases, as a percentage of a nation's population for all nations, are higher than the ones in the first wave, though this may be due to the higher number of tests being conducted. These spikes appear consistent with the four nation governements' decisions to enforce a second lockdown. Northern Ireland appears to be the nation having the highest number of cases as a percentage of its population in the 'second wave'.\n",
